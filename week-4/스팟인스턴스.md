### EC2 Spot Instance Requests

- Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
- Define max spot price and get the instance while current spot price < max
  - The hourly spot price varies based on offer and capacity
  - If the current spot price > your max price you can choose to stop or terminate your instance with a 2 minutes grace period
- Other Strategy : Spot Block
  - "block" spot instance during a specified time frame (1 to 6 hours) without interruptions
  - In rare situations, the instance may be reclaimed
- Used for batch jobs, data analysis, or workloads that are resilient to failures
- Not great for critical jobs or databases

### How to terminate Spot Instances ?

- You can only cancel Spot Instance requests that are open, active or disabled
- Cancelling a spot Request does not terminate instances
- You must first cancel a Spot Reuqest, and then terminate the associated Spot Instances

### Spot Fleet

- Spot Fleets = set of Spot Instances + (optional) On-Demand Instances
- The Spot Fleet will try to meet the target capacity with price constraints
  - Define possible launch pools
  - Can have multiple launch pools
  - Spot Fleet stops launching instances when reaching capacity or max cost
- Strategies to allocate spot instance
  - lowest price
  - diviersified
  - capacityOptimized
  - priceCapacityOptimized
- Spot Fleets allow us to automatically request spot instances with lowest price
